                            and the Sea of Marmara, applied to an apparently impassable obstacle,
                            esp. one that separates lovers, in allusion to the Greek myth of
                            Leander. The myth portrays Leander as a lover of a maiden named Hero; he
                            used to swim across Hellespont to meet Hero every day but gets drowned
                            in one of the attempts. While Bombo simply shifts the meaning of the
                            word hero to the Greek myth, Guido further eludes Bombo as an impassable
                            obstacle by calling the situation a Hellespont. </note>,</l>

                        >Lucrece</name> kill her selfe<note type="Intertextual"> An allusion to
                        Shakespeare’s The Rape of Lucrece, itself an adaptation of the legend of
                        Roman noblewoman Lucretia. In the legend, the son of the king of Rome rapes
                        Lucretia, who then commits suicide. Her body is displayed in the Roman Forum
                        by a nephew of the king, resulting in the banishment of the royal family and
                        the founding of the Roman Republic. In Shakespeare’s adaptation, Lucrece is
                        the wife of a soldier, and the rapist is a friend of her husband and fellow
                        soldier. Lucrece, after suffering this ordeal, ensures revenge will be
                        enacted before she commits suicide. Soldiers carry her body through the
                        streets, and the family of the rapist is exiled. </note></l>
